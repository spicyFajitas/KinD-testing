# Netbox Ansible Installation

This repo is the testing grounds for implementing projects in KinD (kubernetes in docker). It is supposed to be a "portable" repo in the sense that I don't need to `git pull` my entire homalab cookbooks repo onto a work machine and I can use this instead. Think of it as a dev environment for my dev-quality-production-code of my homelab.
